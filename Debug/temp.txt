Nick Mortimer Just wanted to say that I was not referring to comments made here. Thanks for all you heart felt comments. Such views as expressed in Washington Post etc. could be traced back to Thomas Malthus’s Essay on the Principle of Population in 1798 Great Britain at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, he suggested it was primarily the irrational reproductive and productive behaviour of the poor themselves that caused their material deprivation. He ignored the role of the eco- nomic system in the creation of poverty much as we in the North today ignore the role played by globalisation, trade liberalisation and the agricultural policies of leading industrial nations in entrenching poverty and food insecurity in the developing world. For a more satirical read you could read Jonathan Swift's satirical essay from 1729, where he suggests that the Irish eat their own children.

I won't get started on how I deplore racism and struggle with the conflict that as a white male I benefit indirectly from it every day for example the land where my house stands was stolen from the Noongar people the traditional owners of Perth.
